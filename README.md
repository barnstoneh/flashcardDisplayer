# flashcardDisplayer
Allows the user to load flashcards from a file, which will include when the flashcard should be shown next, and displays all the flashcards that are currently due. The user tells you if they got the flashcard right or wrong, and based on that, the code determines when the flashcard should be shown next. The program also allows the user to save the flashcards so that they can restart the program later and look at the flashcards with an updated due date.
